  summary: 'A platform independent file lock.'
  
  description: |
    A filelock provides a synchronisation mechanism between different 
    instances of your application, similar to a thread lock. It can be 
    used to signalize that files, directories or other resources are 
    currently used or manipulated (Think of a sync.lock file). Only the 
    existence of the lockfile is watched for this purpose. The file itself 
    can not be written and is always empty.
