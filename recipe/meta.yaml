  summary: A platform independent file lock.

  description: |
    A filelock provides a synchronisation mechanism between different
    instances of your application, similar to a thread lock. It can be
    used to signalize that files, directories or other resources are
    currently used or manipulated (Think of a sync.lock file). Only the
    existence of the lockfile is watched for this purpose. The file itself
    can not be written and is always empty.
